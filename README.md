# Flatmates-App → fun with OOP 🤪

I have developed a small program with OOP in Python to help you share the monthly bill between you and your flatmate.

---

## Goals

* Revising **Object Oriented Programming** in Python
* Learning to deploy a **Command Line Interface** CLI
* Exploring new developer tools/packages, playing with Python 🐍

## Tools used 

* A Text Editor [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to develop our application.

* [Replit](replit.com)
  
    **Replit** is a website that allows us to build and host projects instantly (production environment).

* [Filestack](https://dev.filestack.com/)

    **Filestack** is a set of developer tools and powerful APIs that allow you to upload, transform and deliver content easily.
    In our case we use it to create a pdf file (that contains the report of the monthly bill) and upload the pdf on the user cloud.
